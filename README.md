# mooapis

This is a central place where we store all of our protocol definitions (i.e. Protobuf files) regarding our services and apis.
We automatically generate the language specific code and push them to different repositories (e.g. [mooapis-go](https://github.com/CowNetwork/mooapis-go)) via CI.
